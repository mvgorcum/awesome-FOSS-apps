Thank you very much for contributing!

*Please make sure you keep the alphabetic order.*

The syntax is the following:
```markdown
  * [AppName](Link to Homepage) - Short description ([F-Droid](Link to the app on F-Droid), [Source Code](Link to the source code))
```
If the app doesn't have a homepage, use
```markdown
  * Appname - Short description ([F-Droid](Link to the app on F-Droid), [Source Code](Link to the source code))
```
If the app is not on F-Droid, provide a link to the page where you can get the .apk file (no direct link), it **must** be from the developer.  
Please use "non-free APK" if the .apk includes non-free parts.
The syntax is:
```markdown
  * Appname - Short description ([APK](Link to the download page of the .apk), [Source Code](Link to the source code))
```

If you want to add another category, use the following syntax:
```markdown
  - [Category name](#category-name)
```
In the list, insert the category with:
```markdown
## Category name
```
Make sure #category-name is identical to the actual category name (Space gets replaced with a `-`).
